This project contains a library to control a robot that uses a Texas Instruments MSP432 microcontroller, Dynamaxel motors (AX-12) and sensors (AX-S1). 
The robot_utils.h and robot_utils.c files contain the library and the implementation of all necessary files. 
The main.c file contains a tested usage example with an autonomous movement algorithm that follows a wall and avoids obstacles.
